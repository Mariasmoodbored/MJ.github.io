										<h1>Inventory redesign</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/Landing.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<h2>Objective</h2>
									<p>The objective of this project was to consolidate the inventory into one. To elevate the user experience and user interface
										so that it is easier for the users to achieve their desired goal.<p>
											
									<h2>How did I do it</h2>
									<p>Here is the design process along with the deliverables given at each milestone.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/invtimeline.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									<h2>Research and analysis</h2>
									<p>Here is the design process along with the deliverables given at each milestone.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In order to start the project, the first aspect I wanted to understand was what and how does the current system works. In order to understand that,me my team member (business analyst)  got hold of the documents and system credentials to study and understand the current process. 
										The objective of these non-structured interviews and workshops were to: <br />  
										- Understand the terminology being used.<br />
										- End to end user journey.<br />
										- Communication within different departments<br />
										- Pain points and challenges. <br />
										<br>
										<p>Following are the pictures of the original inventory interface being used by the users. This was one of the inventories used to check the status of the assets</p>
									
										
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/invlandingpage.jpg"  alt="" /></span>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/invlandingpage2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										<p>We got all the process flow diagrams to get into the detail of how the inventory works and study the movement and approval of assets.</p>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/inventory/invflow1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
										

										<p></p>

									<h2>Qualitative research and workshops</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> Based on the initial system analysis, we held workshops with the respective departments to get answers to all our questions. In parallel to workshops, I organised interview sessions with the team members. It was an intense peice of work as we had to extract years and years of knowledge from the teams present. There were alot of unknowns scenarios which were marked red for the future.</p>
									<p> Following are some of the snippets of the workshop sessions.</p> 

									<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/inventory/workshop1.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
											<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/inventory/workshop2.jpeg" alt="" /></span></div>
											
										</div>
									</div>

						
									<p>The feedback received from the workshops and interviews was interesting yet predictable because of the nature of the user interface being set up. The challenges that surfaced again and again were areas like:<br>
										- Lack of automation and business rules validation<br />
										- Functionality to bulk edit or add<br />
										- Data harmonisation and quality<br />
										- Unable to quickly search and edit the existing data<br />
										<br />
									 The input from these sessions helped me to create current process map. The challenges were documented as in the form of issue its impact and example.

										Once the pain points and challenges were captured, workshop was held to do priority mapping. The objective of this workshop was to document the the pain points but document their impact in the system and in the over all ecosystem with examples.</p>

										<h2>Defining information architecture</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>One of the important issues raised in the workshops was how  finding the information was a hassle since there was no particular structure and hierarchy to the data. It was difficult for any new user to understand the hierarchy of the system. I started the next phase of design consideration with setting up a clear information architecture. With few iterations and changes, option B (right) was finalised.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/IA1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/IA2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> The approach for both the information architecture version were different. In version A, most of the important elements are spread out on level 1. Which gives a clear visibility of all the aspects of inventory.
								
									However, in version B of information architecture, the interconnectivity of the elements was ensured. Which in turn made it the IA go down to level 2 and level 3. Every level was equally important. </p> Tree mapping activity was carried out with the team members to ensure the right placement of elements. Since the objective of the project was to make the interconnectivity of different elements seamless, version B was finalised. 
<br />
<br />
									<h2>Design impact and ideation</h2>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Focusing on the interactional context for each user was important because that would significantly influence the development of the design and key functionalities. Some of the interactive elements that I planned to add were:-<br />
									- Global search functionality<br>
									- Using breadcrumbs for navigation<br>
									- Using incremental progression bar while setting work order<br>
									- Creating clear navigation hierarchy<br>
									- Pre-filled fields: to help the user to not fill out tedious information<br>
									- User validation: to validate fields that are compulsory or optional<br>
									- Continuous feedback: to allow the user to know what action has been taken on the page<br>
									<br>
									<p> Once the design exploration phase started the challenge to not over whelm  the user. I quickly mocked up some basic wireframes to gather feedback from the Engineering and the users. The feedback was on the overall layout and structure of the Inventory Management platform.  This involved establishing a standardised visual hierarchy and layout for the future components.

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/wireframe1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/wireframe3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									
									<h2>Usability testing and refinement</h2>
									<p>Once the wireframes were finalised, I conducted usability testing sessions with our primary users to validate whether the new designs (2 versions )would solve their problems. I wrote a script including different scenarios asking the user e.g. to create new inventory assets and linking them to each other.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>A/B testing was carried out to judge which version was more acceptable with the users and why. I used usability plan dashboard by David Travis.</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/testingchart.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>After setting the objective, the hypothesis and the global questions for the usability test, I started putting up the script, the list of participants, their status and the tasks that will be asked from the user to perform.<p>
									<p>First set of tasks were the cognitive walk through tasks. The objective of adding these tasks were to make them go through the whole platform without performing any specific actions. I wanted to check the navigation of the platform in particular. 'Things to look out for' column was added for every task to help other observers in the session. After 3 cognitive walk through tasks rest of the tasks were actionable. The objective of these tasks were to observe if the user flow was efficient. </p>

										<p>Developers and PO's were a part of the testing sessions. This gave them an insight of how the future design is going to be and what the users think about the interaction pattern. I synthesised the results by making it quantifiable based on if the users were able to perform the given task, if they understood what actions to take and identify the UI elements.<p>
									
										<p>Following is a screenshot of the parameters on which they were observed:</p>

								<h2>Design handover</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/inventory/6.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>After the usability tests were carried out, the results were played back to the business and technology stakeholders and one of the versions was selected. My next step were to work closely with the Engineering team, BAs and POs to provide them with as much information I can. Frequent meetings were held in narrowing down MUP (Minimum Usable Product) . I worked alongside BAs to create tickets and map put process flows. Important artifacts in this process were:<br />
									1. UX blueprint/flows<br>
									2. UI Design</p>

								<h2>Challenges and measure of success</h2>

								<p>like every other project, it had its own challenges was able to put down the success metrics because of usability testing.<p>

							<h3>Challenges </h3>
									
								<p> - Different people were referring to the same concepts with different names.A seperate session was held to define the terminology. <br />
									- Wireframe limitations, few functionalities didn’t work which caused confusion amongst the users. <br />
									- A little nudge was required in the multi step process- probably because of the limitation of the wireframe and no colour to stand out the feedback. <br />
									- There were multiple teams involved with their different ways of working. Bringing them together on a table to work towards one goal was the biggest challenge in this project.<p>
								
										<h3>Success </h3>
				
<p>This is an ongoing project. The inventory management is project is about consolidating different inventories, in parallel the items are being sold how they were. Data migration will be a big step of this project which hasn't been done. <br /> <p>Having said that, I quantified measure of success from the usability testing sessions mentioned above. The results of which were shared with the stakeholders. </p>
